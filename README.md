# ConceptBuilderAI

**Build. Train. Deploy. Optimize.**

ConceptBuilderAI is an open-source MLOps platform designed to manage the complete machine learning lifecycle â€” from feature ingestion and training to deployment, traffic control, and real-time monitoring.

Built Kubernetes-native, event-driven, and fully modular, ConceptBuilderAI provides a secure, scalable foundation for production machine learning systems.

## Features

- **Feature Management** â€” Ingest, validate, and materialize features with version control.
- **Training Orchestration** â€” Launch isolated, reproducible training pipelines with Airflow and Kubernetes.
- **Model Deployment** â€” Deploy models with dynamic traffic routing and live evaluation using Istio.
- **Observability** â€” Full system health tracking with Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Tempo.
- **Security** â€” Proxy-based architecture for safe, auditable external access.

## Architecture

ConceptBuilderAI integrates best-in-class open tools:
- Kubernetes (infrastructure orchestration)
- Kafka (event-driven orchestration)
- Airflow (workflow management)
- Feast (feature store)
- MLflow (model artifact tracking)
- Istio (traffic control and routing)
- Redis (state and validation caching)

All workloads are project-scoped, versioned, and validated for seamless production flow.
